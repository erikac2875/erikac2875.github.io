<h2>Hellow Everyone</h2>
<p>This week in Mr. Alltra's class, AP Computer Science we were making our own flags. Each student got a different flags, which they chose it last week. We were leaning about new contracts that could help our flags look better. We practice some problems before we kept doing our flag and we were learning how to use "place-image". Place-image uses two image, two strings and it outputs one image. We learned how to use place-image by doing some problem solving with a partner. Mr. Allatta set two persons in one computer for the problem solving. After we did some problem solving we began to finish our flags. 
</p>
<p> Some challenges I had while working on my flag were finding the right functions for the shapes to work and how to place the shapes together. For the shapes' functions I looked at pyret shapes 3.19 images and saw the examples. From does examples I was able to make the shapes I need for my flag,Bosnia and Herzegovina. The steps I used to make my geometry national flag were:</p>
 <p> 1. To find the functions and code for each shape separated.</p>
 <p> 2. I found the function for Rectangle, which was my first shape</p>
 <p> 3. I found the function for a right angle was the shape after Rectangle</p>
 <p> 4. The last shape in my flag was a star. </p>
 <p> When I was using the functions to start the flag, one thing I forgot was to write first "include image". If I don't include that then the program will not allow me to access the images folder from pyret. </p>
 <p> My last step, to able to complete my flag was to place the images together. I used to be able to place images together, but I forgot. I was wondering and looking around in Pyret page/images to see if anything will help. I tryed everything but the program still didn't work. Combining images was my biggest challenge in this program. When Mr. Allatta us back to tables, he asked us What functions have we used to combine images together. That's when we notice that overlay was not going to work for this project, but place-image did. I try it with place-image and it worked. Now I know a new function named place-image. It was fun doing this mini project.
