<h2>Hellow Everyone</h2>
<p>This week in Mr. Alltra's class, AP Computer Science we were making our own flags. Each student got a different flags, which they chose it last week. We were leaning about new contracts that could help our flags look better. We practice some problems before we kept doing our flag and we were learning how to use "place-image". Place-image uses two image, two strings and it outputs one image. We learned how to use place-image by doing some problem solving.
