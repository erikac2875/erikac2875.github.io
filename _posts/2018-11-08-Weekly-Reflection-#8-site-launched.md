<h2>Hello Everyone</h2>
<p>This week we were working on Data Definitions. We were talking about math and how to connected to computer. we connected graphs to coordinates. Coordinates is a definatintion of the kind of data we used for this week.Data definition is similar to data table because both of them have names, strings, numbers and Booleans.For example:
  </p>
  <u>Data Definitions<u/>
  <p>data CakeType:</p>
  <p> |cake( </p>
  <p>flavor::string,</p>
  <p>layers::number,</p>
  <p>is-icecream::Boolean)</p>
  <p>end</p>
