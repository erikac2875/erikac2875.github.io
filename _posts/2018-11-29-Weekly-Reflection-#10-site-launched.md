<h2>Hello Everyone</h2>
<p>Early this week we took a MidTerm exam in AP Computer Science. We only had one hour to complete this exam. It was sort of difficult. After the exam we did Midterm item analysis. We were talking about the mastery skills that were in the exam and what the levels mean. Then we were told to get any question that we want to used from the exam. One questions I am going to use is:<p>
  <p>Which function application matches the contract below?</p>
  <p># message-cost :: Number -> Number</p>
  <br/>(a)message-cost(16)
  <br/>(b)message-cost("where are you?")
  <br/>(c)message-cost(25,15)
  <br/>(d)prefer-flavor("lemon","lime")
  
  <p>Correct Answer(a)</p>
  <p>The mastery Skill that was involved in this question was Ms1, it is an Apprentice level</p>
