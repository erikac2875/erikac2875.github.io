<h2>Hellow Everyone</h2>
<p> This week in AP Computer Science we were analyzing data and making connections. Last week were creating our flags and we were using data. Now this week we were learning new data. We were using charts mostly this week, but there is still different way we can used data in class or anywhere else. To make a page we use data and making a flag, chart games. Today everything goes throught data. We were learning aboaut Categorial and Quantitative. An example for Categorial will be car and for Quantitative will be price.
  
In class we were learning different functions. One is Pie-chart we were trying to output and Images but it was really hard for and my partner. We follow the Pie-chart's function but it didn't work. Pie-chart has a table, two strings and outputs and Image. It sounds easy to get an output but actually wasnt' for me. It was cool in learning more about data.
