<h2>Hellow Everyone</h2>
<p>This week on AP Computer Science we were answering the question: What is the difference between a Contract and Example? A contract is a step by step process and a example is where is checked if its correct. </p>
 <p>A example of a contract is double::(a-num::number)->number</p>
 <p>example of a example is: check: double(5) is 10 and double(0) is 0</p>
 <p>This week we did many different type of contracts and examples. In one example we use the word "fun". In pyret, "fun" is a key words that defines a function. For example: Fun f(x):3x(x+9) end, then we work with f(x) and subtitude x for any kind of number. We did some problems with out partners and then ourselves. One problem I had with the contracts was when I was supposed to match two contracts with three examples. It was fun learning about the difference between a contract and example.
