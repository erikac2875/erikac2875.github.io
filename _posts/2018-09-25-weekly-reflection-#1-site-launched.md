<h2>Hello Everyone</h2>
<p>This is my first reflection of last week in AP Computer Science classes. Last week, in AP Computer Science class we have been learning, how to create our first blog page.</p>
<p>
I like computer science because it's completely in a different language, but it's interesting while learning. When I first was learning about coding it was difficult because I didn't know nothing about it. It was hard and sometimes it still is today for me. For example, when I code in HTML I forget how to wite a page in code. I do sometimes struggle through it and when I do I ask my partner for help but if she or he do not know either then I ask my teacher for help.</p>
