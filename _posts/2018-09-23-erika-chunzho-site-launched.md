<h3>Hello everyone,</h3>
<p>These past two weeks, in AP Computer Science class we have been learning, how to create our first blog page.</p>
<p2>I like computer science because it's completely in a different language, but it's interesting while learning. When I first was learningabout coding it was difficult because I didn't know nothing about it. It was hard and sometimes it still is today for me. For example, when I code in HTML I forget how to wite a page in code. I do sometimes struggle through it and when I do I ask my partner for help but if she or he do not know either then I ask my teacher for help.</p2>
