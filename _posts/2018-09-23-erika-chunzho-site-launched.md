"First few weeks" Hello everyone, This past weeks, in my AP Computer Science class we have been learning how to create our first blog page.
I like computer science because it's completely in a different language, but it's interesting while learning. When I first was learning
about coding it was difficult because I did not know nothing about it. It was hard and sometimes it still is today for me. For example, 
when I code in HTML I forget how to do a page.I do sometimes struggle through it and when I do I ask my partner for help but if she or he 
do not know either then I ask my teacher for help.
