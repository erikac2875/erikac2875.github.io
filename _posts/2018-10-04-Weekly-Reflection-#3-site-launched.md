<h2>Hello Everyone</h2>
<p>This past week we were learning about HTML/CSS, diffferent type of data and a flag project. 
</p>
<p>We worked on HTML/CSS, where we were learning how to style our pages and making connections between concepts in computing. We went to a page Colurlovers.com/palettes and we pick a paletter/color and we wrote the name and values of it. In HTML we were leaning the different structures of HTML. Each student picked three tags that didn't know of HTML code and did research of the meaning of the tag in www.w3schools.com and after we read the information and wrote down some info about it. We teached our partners about the tags we and than we shared with the class. Another aim we learned this week was different type of data for example; booleans, string, numbers, and images. Some of my classmates and I learned this last year in freshman year in Computational Algebra with Mr. Allatta (he teaches Ap Computer Science, too), but even thought I learned it last year, I forgot how to use the tools, I'm glad I am still learning it this year too. Using these tools we designing a program to represent a flag of a country and we are creating a flag in https://code.pyret.org/editor. Overall, we learned about Vexillology, which means study of flags, symbols and geometries. Mr. Alltta, also tough us that "our program should speak the language of the problem we are trying to solve.
