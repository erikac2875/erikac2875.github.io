<h2>Hello Everyone</h2>
<p>This week in Ap Computer Science, we were learning about different type of shapes, contracts & API (which standsfor Application Programming Interface) and we were programimg flags. Each student had to pick a flag and see what shapes make the flag they picked. We did an arts and crafts before we started coding our flags on the computers. We were cutting color paper to make our flags. Then to code we use a website called Pyret. Mr. Allatta did a lesson for 20 minutes about contracts & API. He showed us the rule of a reactanlge. The first on was not an actual rule of a reactangle but the second one was an actual example that could be used in Pyret. 
</p>
<p>During in the flag project I had problems in starting but then I was able to make a rectangle, star, and a triangle-sas.I learned how to make an triangle-sas. I moved the angles from a regular triangle to a triangle-sas.
