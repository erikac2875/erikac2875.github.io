<h2>Hello Everyone</h2>
<p>This week in Ap Computer Science, we were learning about different type of shapes, contracts & API (which standsfor Application Programming Interface) and we were programimg flags. Each student had to pick a flag and see what shapes make the flag they picked. We did an arts and crafts before we started coding our flags on the computers. We were cutting color paper to make our flags. Then to code we use a website called Pyret. Mr. Allatta did a lesson for 20 minutes about contracts & API. He showed us the rule of a reactanlge. The first on was not an actual rule of a reactangle but the second one was an actual example that could be used in Pyret. 
</p>
<p>During the flag project I had problems in starting but when Mr. Allatta give a example I was able to started forming the figures of my star. I was able to make a rectangle, star, and a triangle-sas. I was fun learned how to make an triangle-sas and moving the angles from a regular triangle to a triangle-sas. Now, for my next step I have to combine my figures together meaning I have to use the Overal rule to be able to combine them. I have some trouble how to combine them. I have try some formulas about overal and how to combine them but it hasn't been easy. I am still trying how to combine them together. That's one of my biggest challenges for now.
