<h2>Hellow Everyone</h2>
<p> This week in AP Computer Science we were analyzing data and making connections. Last week were creating our flags and we were using data. Now this week we were learning new data. We were using charts mostly this week, but there is still different way we can used data in class or anywhere else. To make a page we use data and making a flag, charts and games. Today everything goes throught data. We were learning about Categorial and Quantitative. An example for Categorial will be car and for Quantitative will be price.

In class we were learning different functions. One is Pie-chart we were trying to output and Images but it was really hard for and my partner. We follow the Pie-chart's function but it didn't work. Pie-chart has a table, two strings and outputs and Image. It sounds easy to get an output but actually wasn't for me. I am still learning how to get an output from Pie-chart. It's cool learning more about data. Like I said now a day we use data everywhere, at least some. I also learned how to get a output, which was a table with different functions. This was a google classroom discussion. We were looking in a code about tables and we wrote what we see and wonder. I wrote that the code didn't work and then some of my classmates gave me feedback and what I needed to write. For the second classroom discussion I knew what to do.
