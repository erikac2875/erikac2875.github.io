<h3>Hello Everyone</h3>
<p>This week in AP Computer Science class we have been adding our first weekly reflection from last week and also some classmates that were done with their blog we helped my other classmates complete theirs because they had trouble understanding the instructions. Some of them had every single step corretly but their blog was not working, so it was hard to see what was wrong with it. When I saw her code again, I saw it really closely and I notice a small error. </p>

<p>  We Played Video game. Each group had to select a game and play the same game, and answer two questions in one question: What changes?; What is changing?, and how does it change?. I had never played a game and that was the first time I played. The game my group and I played was "Death Rn 3D". It was fun playing the game with my group. The game was hard because it went fast and the colors kept making me confused and including the blocks kept moving a lot. </p>

<p>We also did a "Flip Book Animation", it was really exciting working on it. It was my first flip book animation. Our book was about a ball falling to the ground and we also did it on the computer, in "http://code.pyret.org/editor". There are two sides; one is the right side which is the definitions and the left side is interactions. On the computer was hard because I didn't know what to write in the interactions side. </p>
